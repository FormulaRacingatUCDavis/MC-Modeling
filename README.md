## Select Operating point/Motor (Conrad)
- [ ] Make Design Matrix
- Cost is determining factor
  - Find cheapest analogy to our current motor
       - Encoderless? 
       - ask Elliot, Tucker
  - LV (0 - 12V)
    - Safety, cheaper
  - HV (48V +)
    - Maybe more realistic?
  - TestPack Voltage?

## Select Microcontroller/Launchpad (Leo)
- Metrics
     - COST
     - Speed
     - High frequency PWM
     - High speed ADC
- TI - suitable chip-line
     - Piccolo

# Future Concerns

Select Driving Circuitry
- FET/IGBT
- Driving IC

How To Quantify Performance?

Board design for high frequency performance?
